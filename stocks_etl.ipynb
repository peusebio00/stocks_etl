    "__`shared`__ is a Class from the Yahoo Finance module which __allows users to detect errors thrown from the data extraction__. By default, such errors __would not cause an actual Python Error to be thrown, but would rather be displayed as a simple Warning message__; This could be problematic as an actual Error not being thrown could allow for __data extraction failures to go undetected, which would affect the script's subsequent execution__\n",
    "* So as to avoid Errors going undetected, we use the __`shared`__ Class's __`._ERRORS`__ attribute, which returns a Python dictionary where the __keys are the stock tickers which caused Errors to be thrown__\n",
    "    * As such, by executing __list(shared.\\_ERRORS.keys())__, we get back a standard list object, which would contain  the stock tickers that returned Errors in the data extraction stage\n",
    "    * The fundamental concept here is that __list(shared.\\_ERRORS.keys())__ will only contain items <u>if an error occurs during the data extraction from Yahoo finance</u> for any of our previously-defined tickers --> Otherwise, it would be left empty, and thus have a __`len()`__ of 0\n",

    "            * We also raise __`StopIteration`__ so __no other cells are executed after the error has been detected__ and the email has been sent, thus effectively ending the entire script's execution, as it would not make sense to move forward if errors have been thrown from the data extraction and the data is thus not right.\n",
    "        * __If it is NOT greater than 0__, that would mean that __no errors would have occurred in the data extraction stage__, and thus everything would have gone according to plan;\n",
